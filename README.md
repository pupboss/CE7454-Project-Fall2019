# CE7454 Project: Movie Rating and Box-office Prediction

*Group 26: Li Jie, Shen Meng, Wang Ruihang*

Welcome to the our project! In this work, we are going to save the viewers and producers from the ocean of movies. Our job is to give a reliable prediction of a movies's rating and box-office before its theatrical release, aiming to offer useful information in an early stage. 

**In this project, we will:**

- Crawl and build our dataset from [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com)
- Clean and present the raw data for analysis
- Apply different models for movie rating and box-office prediction
- Propose our new architecture for further improvement
- Compare and analyze the results of each method
